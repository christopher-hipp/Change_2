1. What is the project?

</details>

2. What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?
The MVP will consist of a program that has:
  a. an array of predefined values that add up to 1000;
      - use same values as in original challenge;

        6, 9, 19, 28, 22, 19, 35,
        15, 6, 28, 20, 17, 18, 22,
        4, 20, 8, 26, 19, 15, 29,
        5, 17, 11, 19, 9, 21, 60,
        31, 18, 22, 27, 5, 23, 0,
        8, 21, 15, 40, 12, 34, 11,
        19, 25, 13, 22, 17, 9, 51,
        33, 17

  a. the ability to give a random value from the array;
      - select random value;
      - display the value to the user;
  b. the ability to keep track of changes in the array; and
      - add selected random value to array of used values;
      - remove selected random value from active array;
  c. the ability to show the total amount saved in a separate array.
      - add used values to get the total amount saved.

3. What are the nice to haves?
The nice to haves are the following:
  a. the ability to allow custom amount to be saved;
  b. the ability to randomise the values in the array, given that the total of these values is the custom amount;
  c. a simple visual representation of the array and values in the terminal,
      - and later on a proper GUI;
  d. the ability to allow multiple savings profiles; and
  e. the ability to show the user's savings history.

4. When will the project be complete?
When all of the above has been fulfilled. New ideas and improvements are welcomed throughout this process.
Project will be complete when I am happy with it, not when it gets difficult.
