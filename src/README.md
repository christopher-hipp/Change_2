## What is the project?
The Main project is a project to build an application that gives the user an amount of money to put into savings from your budget.

The basis for this idea is **Rahakratt's Challenge**.

</details>

## What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?
The MVP will consist of a program that has:
1. an array of predefined values that add up to 1000;

  a. use same values as in original challenge (for some reason the total of these values is 1020, not 1000);

        6, 9, 19, 28, 22, 19, 35,
        15, 6, 28, 20, 17, 18, 22,
        4, 20, 8, 26, 19, 15, 29,
        5, 17, 11, 19, 9, 21, 60,
        31, 18, 22, 27, 5, 23, 0,
        8, 21, 15, 40, 12, 34, 11,
        19, 25, 13, 22, 17, 9, 51,
        33, 17, 20

2. the ability to give a random value from the array;

  a. select random value;
  b. display the value to the user;

3. the ability to keep track of changes in the array; and

  a. add selected random value to array of used values;
  b. remove selected random value from active array;

4. the ability to show the total amount saved in a separate array.

  a. add used values to get the total amount saved.

## What are the nice to haves?
The nice to haves are the following:
1. the ability to allow custom amount to be saved;
2. the ability to randomise the values in the array, given that the total of these values is the custom amount;
3. a simple visual representation of the array and values in the terminal,

  a. and later on a proper GUI;

4. the ability to allow multiple savings profiles; and
5. the ability to show the user's savings history.

**Note that this list is not exhaustive and will be subject to change as I progress.**

## When will the project be complete?
When all of the above has been fulfilled. New ideas and improvements are welcomed throughout this process.
Project will be complete when I am happy with it, not when it gets difficult.
