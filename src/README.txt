2. What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?
- The MVP will consist of a program that has:
    1. an array of predefined values that add up to 1000;
        a. use same values as in original challenge;

        6, 9, 19, 28, 22, 19, 35,
        15, 6, 28, 20, 17, 18, 22,
        4, 20, 8, 26, 19, 15, 29,
        5, 17, 11, 19, 9, 21, 60,
        31, 18, 22, 27, 5, 23, 0,
        8, 21, 15, 40, 12, 34, 11,
        19, 25, 13, 22, 17, 9, 51,
        33, 17

    2. the ability to give a random value from the array;
        a. select random value;
        b. display the value to the user;
    3. the ability to keep track of changes in the array; and
        a. add selected random value to array of used values;
        b. remove selected random value from active array;
    4. the ability to show the total amount saved in a separate array.
        a. add used values to get the total amount saved.

3. What are the nice to haves?
- The nice to haves are the following:
    1. the ability to allow custom amount to be saved;
    2. the ability to randomise the values in the array, given that the total of these values is the custom amount;
    3. a simple visual representation of the array and values in the terminal,
        a. and later on a proper GUI;
    4. the ability to allow multiple savings profiles; and
    5. the ability to show the user's savings history.

4. When will the project be complete?
- When all of the above has been fulfilled. New ideas and improvements are welcomed throughout this process.
Project will be complete when I am happy with it, not when it gets difficult.
